# Getting Started Coding Challenge
In this challenge, there is no step-by-step guide and no hints. However, if you get really stuck, the full solution is located in the ChallengeSolution folder.

#	Steps
Locate the GettingStartedChallenge.Code console application. Open the ```Program.cs``` files and add code to the ```main``` function that does the following:

-	Displays a prompt asking the user for their name and inputs their response
-	Displays a message that says "Hello, ___" (where their name is filled in)
-	Asks the user how old they are, and stores their response as an integer
-	Displays the message "You are nn years old" where nn is the userâ€™s age
-	Asks the user for their date of birth, and stores their response in a DateTime variable
-	Displays the message "You are nnn days old" where nnn is the total number of days that the user has been alive
